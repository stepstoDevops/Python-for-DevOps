Steps to Access Your GitHub from Local System and Add/Commit Files

Here’s a complete, step-by-step guide to setting up an SSH key for GitHub :

1. Generate an SSH Key Pair

Open your terminal and run -
> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
  Replace "your_email@example.com" with your GitHub email.

2. Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent

Start the SSH agent and add your new key -
> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
(If you used a different filename, adjust accordingly.)

3. Copy the Public Key

Copy your public key to the clipboard:
> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
 Copy the entire output.

4. Add the Public Key to GitHub

* Log in to GitHub.
* Click your profile photo → Settings.
* Go to SSH and GPG keys.
* Click New SSH key or Add SSH key.
* Paste your public key into the "Key" field.
* Add a descriptive title.
* Click Add SSH key.

5. Test the SSH Connection

Run:
> ssh -T git@github.com
This command tests your SSH connection to GitHub

If your SSH key is set up correctly, you should see :

Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Now you can use SSH to clone, push, and pull from your GitHub repositories without entering your username or password each time.
